It is designed to perfectly fit Windows 11 esthetics, with rounded corners and blurred "frosted glass" background. Photos and description are loaded from [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/) by NASA.

Left click on the image will open it in a new window for further investigation, and left click on the description will open a web page with the full description.
